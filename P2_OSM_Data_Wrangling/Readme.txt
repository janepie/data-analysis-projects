This Zipfile includes my work for the Nanodegree Project 2 Wrangle OSM Data.

In here you will find
- OSM_Data_Wrangling as html and ipynb where I describe my way of working and the outcome
- Folder img including the image used for the notebook
- Python scripts
	- create_sample.py to create the sample file
	- xml_to_csv.py to transform the OSM data into different csv's
	- csv_to_xml.py to transform these csv's into an SQLite database
	- schema1.py to provide the database schema
- sample_hambnurg_stade.osm is the sample generated with k = 1000
- Overpass_Link.txt includes the link used to download the data
- Sources.txt includes all used sources
- and, obviously, this readme file

Happy reviewing!

Note: this is the second submission. I updated xml_to_csv.py with the proposed improvement and added some discussion to the notebook in Chapter 'How to get better data'
